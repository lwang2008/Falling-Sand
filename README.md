# Falling Sand Simulation

A Java-based simulation that demonstrates the behavior of falling sand particles in a grid-based environment. This project showcases basic physics simulation and particle system concepts.

## About

This project implements a falling sand simulation where sand particles fall and interact with each other based on simple physics rules. The simulation provides a visual representation of how sand particles behave when dropped into a container.

## Features

- Real-time sand particle simulation
- Interactive grid-based environment
- Visual display of particle movement
- Configurable simulation parameters

## Project Structure

- `SandLab.java` - Main simulation logic and particle behavior
- `SandDisplay.java` - GUI implementation and visualization
- Additional configuration files for project setup

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Any Java IDE (recommended: Eclipse)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE
3. Run the `SandLab` class to start the simulation

## How It Works

The simulation uses a grid-based system where:
- Each cell can contain either sand or be empty
- Sand particles fall downward due to gravity
- Particles can stack and form piles
- The simulation updates in real-time
